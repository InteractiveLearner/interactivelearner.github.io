# Projection Types
When it comes to presenting maps to readers, geographers must choose a projection that is appropriate for the map's purpose and location. Projections transform three-dimensional curved surfaces to two-dimensional flat surfaces. Consequently, such transformations cause distortion to the maps. The following are the 4 types in which the relationship between features on a map may be distorted or preserved:

1. **Distance (Equidistant)**
   - Preserves distance between features
2. **True Direction (Azimuth)**
   - Preserves direction between features
   - Measured in degrees (Â°)
3. **Shape / Angle (Conformal)**
   - Cannot preserve shape and area at the same time
   - Continents distorted
4. **Area (Equal-Area)**
   - Distorts distance and shape
   - Preserves features to their exact size

# Projection Techniques

The projection techniques, which affect the **longitude** (vertical lines) and **latitude** (horizontal lines) on a map, are another significant factor to consider. The following are the 3 primary projection techniques:

1. **Cylindrical**
   - Longitude lines appear straight, equally spaced, and parallel
   - Latitude lines appear straight, and sometimes not consistently equally spaced
2. **Conical**
   - Longitude lines appear as diverging
   - Latitude lines appear circular around the poles
3. **Azimuthal** (or Planar)
   - Increasingly distorted from the centre point (typically the South or North Pole as the centre point)
   - Longitude lines appear equally spaced and straight which become increasingly radiant
   - Latitude lines appear as equally spaced centric circles
