# Reference Maps

**Reference maps** serve a general purpose. They can be found in the form of transit maps, topographic maps, road maps, hiking trail maps, and so on. The Scale Map you saw in the [Scales](https://www.interactivelearner-gis.com/#/scale) chapter is considered a reference map because it had no intended theme and only showed the location and names of features.

# Thematic Maps

**Thematic maps**, unlike reference maps, serve a special purpose. Exploratory data analysis, for example, could be used to uncover patterns and relationships in spatial data. A thematic map's theme(s) are made up of a mix of marks, channels, quantitative and/or qualitative data, and sometimes even a base map that serves as a point of reference.

Thematic mapping channel selections are linked to the **expressiveness types** and **effectiveness ranks** principles. The expressiveness types principle seeks to match a data type with the appropriate channel. The effectiveness ranks principle simply argues that not all channels are created equal, and that certain channels have a higher importance than others.

# Exploration of Thematic Maps

Now that you've learned how thematic maps are designed, it is time to explore and learn about the types of thematic maps. Here are some suggestions to consider as you explore:
- Can you identify which channels were used to create each of the thematic maps? The Channel Ranking figure could be useful.
- The dot density maps's view is set to World. people. Notice how the dots begin to indicate a different number of people when you zoom in to a Continent or Country level.
<!-- - There is no diagram symbol map below. However, an example can still be seen on this page. Did you notice that pie charts were one of the hospital shape styles in the Visually Encoded Map? Despite the fact that the pie charts in the Visually Encoded Map contain meaningless data, they could, for example, represent each hospital's budget categories. -->
